Go-Logout Menu


## Installation
First download stack by `curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh`

Download through the "Download Source code", any format you want.

Then extract it and run `stack setup` then run `stack build`, its gonna take a while, so wait then run `stack run` on terminal.

It should be running.
## Usage
You can click any of the buttons and they are supposed to do what they say, and the names might be different than the usual so here's a list:

Go Back - Exit Program

Go Out - Log Out

Restart - Reboot

Shutoff - Shutdown

SUSeep - Suspend / Sleep

FastSUS - Hibernate

Logock - Go to Lock Screen

## Roadmap
Replace the images with drawn ones for cool aesthetic!

## Contributing
I'm open to contributions, as long as it doesnt change much of the look of the project (Images are fine but Names are probably not.)

See Installation for testing and developing for the program.

Other than above,`stack run` is all you need when you are done setting up.
